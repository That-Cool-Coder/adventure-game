        <p>Adventure Game is an experimental game that I've been building for about 10 weeks. It contains over 3000 lines of code, which is twice as big as any of my other projects. The name 'Adventure Game' is a working title and will be revised in future.</p>

        <p>All of my sound effects are from the community-contributed database on freesound.org. They have the Creative Commons 0 licence, so you can download them from here and use them if you wish.</p>
        <p>I made all of the images myself, which is why they're not very good</p>
        <p>This project wouldn't have been possible without the p5.js library, so thank you to the p5 team</p>
